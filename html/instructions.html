    <h2> <u><b>Citizen scientsts can collect data for NYeBear in three ways </b></u>: </h2>
    <h3><ul>
<li> The <b>first way  </b>is <a href="#Data from Hikes/Observations">to go on  hikes </a>and then report information about it: date, route, any observations of bears, etc. 
We recommend that citizen scientists repeat their hikes and trails every few weeks to collect data for the same places. 
<li> A <b>second way </b> is <a href="#Data from Trail Cameras"> to set a trail camera on your property </a>and routinely check and report photos from it.
<li>The <b> third way </b> is <a href="#Data from Study Site Checks"> to monitor specific research sites</a> for black bear hair. We are still developing this - stay tuned!

    <h3><u>Data from Hikes and Observations</u></h3>
    <h4>There are 3 ways to collect and submit data from hikes/observations: (See below for more details)</h4>
    <OL>
        <li> <a href="#Using NYeBear App">Using the  NYeBear app</a>: We recommend this method if you have a smartphone. It is easiest and provides us with more accurate and real-time data.
            <li> <a href="#Using the Paper version">Using print-out datasheets</a>: If you don't have a smartphone, you may print out a paper version to take with you when you are out. <a href="../hikesheet.pdf" target="_blank">Click here to print the paper datasheet </a> Bring a GPS unit to record your hike as GPS waypoints. Then you can scan it into the computer and submit it as a hike/observation on the website, or snail-mail it to us at:

    </OL>
    &nbsp;** Submit hikes and observations regardless of whether or not you actually saw a bear or bear signs.**

    <h4><i>Using NYeBear App</i></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>When you start a hike, turn <b>ON</b> the "Start a Hike"/ "Track Hiking" function.
            <ul>
                <li> It is never too late to start a hike, even if you forgot to do this until you had an observation to report!
                    <li> If you did not go on a hike and are reporting a standalone observation, skip this step.</ul>
            <li> When/if you observe a bear or signs of bear (hair/scat/pawprint) go to "Report Data" and choose "Report an Observation".
                <li> Fill out the requested information:
                    <ol type="a">
                        <li> The "Use current location" button automatically fill the fields with your current location, and should only be used if you are actually where you made your observation.
                            <li> Check all the signs that you observed.
                                <li> Rate how confident you are about the sign being from black bear: 1=low to 5=high
                                    <li> We recommend attaching photo(s) of your bear observation or sign.
                                        <li> Provide any other comments about your observation.
                                            <li> Submit! Congratulations! :) </ol>

                <li> When you start your hike, record the start time and GPS coordinates on the first row.
                    <li> At regular intervals (we suggest choosing either 5,10, or 15 minutes;more frequent is better but no more than 15 minutes),
