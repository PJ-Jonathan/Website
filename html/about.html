	NY eBear collects data submitted by normal people about where they have, and have not seen bears. In addition we collect data from people who have trail cameras set up, and people who check bear hair traps that we have set up. This black bear population study is being administered by Cornell University, and the data will be used by the Department of Environmental Conservation to help better inform bear population management in New York. The more data we receive the more accurately we will be able to determine the location and quantity of Black Bears in New York.
