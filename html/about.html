NYeBear is a citizen science project in New York where citizens submit information  from 1) hikes, 2) trail
cameras, and 3) research sites about where they see (and don’t see!) signs of black bears. It is accessible 
by website and smartphone via an app. This data goes towards helping researchers monitor the black 
bear population. The more people who participate in NYeBear and submit information, the more 
accurately researchers can determine the population size, range, and other important aspects of black 
bear ecology in New York.

<p>
Black bears are an important wildlife species in New York. They are one of our largest mammals in the
state, and many people enjoy seeing bears and bear sign in the wild. However, the number and intensity 
of negative human-bear interactions, including motor vehicle collisions, property and agricultural 
damage has been increasing because  the population has been growing and their range has been 
expanding (due to conservative management and the reversion of many farmlands back to forest).
</p>

<p>
Maintaining a population size of bears in the state that is healthy and safe for both bears and human is 
an important management objective. As the bear population grows and their range expands in New 
York, researchers need data from all across the state about 
where there are and aren’t bears. Approximately 89% of land in New York is privately owned, so 
researchers need the help of citizens to do this.
