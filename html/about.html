            <h3 style="margin-right:5;margin-left:5;"> About the creators of NY eBear </h3>
            <p style="margin-right:5;margin-left:5;"><b>Cat Sun </b> is a graduate student in the Department of Natural at Cornell University. She is also a student of the <a href="http://www.coopunits.org/New_York/"> New York Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit. </a> She is studying black bears in New York to better understand their population size, distribution across the state, and patterns of resource use. To make NYeBear, she is collaborating with <b> PJ Finlay</b> and <b>Jonathan Gomes Selman</b>, who are currently students at Ithaca High School. PJ and Jonathan have developed the iOS and Android apps for NYeBear and also are the brains behind managing all the technology behind the data collection.</p>

                <p><b><i> NYeBear is a citizen science project in New York where citizens and researchers work together to collect data on the presence and absence of black bears across upstate New York. </i>  </b></p>
                
 <p><strong>Black</strong> bears are an important wildlife species in New York. They are one of our largest mammals in the state, and many people enjoy seeing bears and bear sign in the wild.  However, <i>negative</i> bear interactions are on the rise (ex: motor vehicle collisions, property and agricultural damage) because the population has been growing since the 1950s. Their range in New York has also been expanding due to successful management and the reversion of many farmlands back to forest.</p>
 <p> <strong>Maintaining </strong> a population size of bears in the state that is healthy and safe for both bears and people is an important management objective. Researchers need to ask, "How many bears are there? Where are they?". Working with the public is a way to collect data from all across the state about where there are and aren't bears, since approximately 89% of land in New York is privately owned.</p>
<hr>
<p> <b>You can be a citizen scientist and assist in black bear management in New York!</b> If you spend time outdoors in New York, be a part of <b>NYeBear</b>. Submit information from <i>hikes</i>, <i>personal trail cameras</i>, and <i>research sites</i> about when and where you see (and don't see!) signs of black bears. The more people who participate in NYeBear and submit information, the more it helps researchers determine the population size, range, and other important aspects of black bear ecology in New York.</p>
<br/> <p>NYeBear is accessible by website, smartphone, and paper and mail. Visit the <a href="instructions.html"> Instructions page </a> to learn more about how to collect data. These data go directly towards helping researchers at Cornell University and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation monitor the black bear population. </p>
