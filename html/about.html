	<h3>NYeBear is a citizen science project in New York. You can be a citizen scientist!</h3>
	<p> Do you enjoy the outdoors? Do you walk in the woods, or like to hike?
Do you have a trail camera in some woods on your property? With NYeBear, your time spent outside can help inform black bear management in New York.
Citizens can submit information from hikes, personal trail cameras, and research sites about when they see (and don't see!) signs of black bears.
<br></br>NYeBear is accessible by website, smartphone, and paper and mail. Visit the <a href> How to Submit Data and Observations </a>
to learn more about the data collection process.</p>
	<p>This data goes towards data goes towards helping researchers at Cornell University and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
 monitor the black bear population. The more people who participate in NYeBear and submit information, the more accurately researchers can determine 
the population size, range, and other important aspects of black bear ecology in New York.</p>
	<p>Black bears are an important wildlife species in New York. They are one of our largest mammals in the state, and many people enjoy 
seeing bears and bear sign in the wild. However, the number and intensity of negative human-bear interactions, including motor vehicle collisions, 
property and agricultural damage has been increasing because the population has been growing. The black bear range in New York has also been expanding,
due to successful, conservative management and the reversion of many farmlands back to forest.
</p>
	<p>Maintaining a population size of bears in the state that is healthy and safe for both bears and people is an important management objective. 
As the bear population grows and their range expands in New York, researchers need data from all across the state about where there are and aren't bears.
Since approximately 89% of land in New York is privately owned, citizens can provide valuable data to help management.
</p>

Conservation&#39;s website</a>.</p>
