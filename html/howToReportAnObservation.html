<h2><u>Data from Hikes and Observations</u></h2>
<h4>There are 3 ways to collect and submit data: (See below for details)</h4>
  <OL> <li> <a href="#Using NYeBear App">Use the  NYeBear app</a>: If you have a smartphone, we recommend this. It is easiest and provides us with more accurate and real-time data.
       <li> <a href="#Using the Paper version">Use paper</a>: If you don't have a smartphone, you may print out a paper version to take with you when you are out. Bring a GPS unit to record your  hike as GPS waypoints. Then you can scan it into the computer and send it to us through the website, or snail-mail it to us at:<br >

       <li> <a href="#Use this website">Using this website</a>: If you did not go on a hike but observed a bear, you can submit it through the app or the online form.
  </OL>
**You should submit observations/data regardless of whether or not you actually saw a bear or signs of bear. All hikes and observations are important ecause they allow researchers to accurately estimate the range of black bears in New York. **

     <li> When/if you observe a bear or signs of bear (hair/scat/pawprint) go to "Report an Observation"
     <li> Fill out the requested information:
		<ol type="a"><li> Use the "Use current location" button to automatically fill the fields with your current location, and should only be used if you are actually where you made your observation.
		    <li> Check all the signs that you observed.
		    <li> Rate how confident you are about the sign being from black bear: 1=low to 5=high
		    <li> We recommend attaching photo(s) of your bear observation or sign.
		    <li> Provide any other comments about your observation.
