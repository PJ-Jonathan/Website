<h3>You should submit trail camera data if you have a trail camera in operation, even if it has not seen a Black bear. It is very important for ous statistical model that people submit data from their trail cameras even if they  have not seen a bear.</h3>
<h3>To submit fill in your email, the time that your trail camera was operational, and the location of your camera. Next enter any bear observations that your camera had, leaving the field blank if your camera did not see any bears. Finally attach the photo, if you have access to it.</h3>
