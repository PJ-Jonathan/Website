<b>1) How many bears are in New York?</b><br>
	The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation estimates about 6,000-8,000 bears in New York. 
	There are approximately 3,200 in the Adirondacks, 1,800 in the Catskill region, and 1,000 in central-western New York.
	An objective of NYeBear is to help the NYSDEC refine their estimates of population size and distribution of bears in the state.
</p>
<p>
<b>2) Why are there more bears in New York now?</b><br>
	<i>Short answer</i>: Successfull black bear management and more habitat that bears use.<br />
	<i>Long answer </i>: Back in the 18th and 19th centuries, black bear population in New York and across the eastern United States decreased drastically due 
	to hunting and loss of forest habitat due to the creating of farmlands. In 1903, bears in New York became protected and 
	hunting became regulated. At the same time, larges areas of farmland reverted back to forest land.  In the 1950s, there were 
	3 main regions of black bears in New York: Adirondacks Range, Catskill Range, and the Allegany Range. As the population continues
	to grow, the ranges have been expanding, especially northwards into central New York.  Now, the Catskill and Allegany Ranges have merged into a 
	single, Southern Black Bear Range that encompasses the southern part of upstate New York. The Adirondack Range has been relatively stable 
	and is now the Northern Black Bear Range. The current range boundaries are based on primarily on reports of bears with cubs. An objective of NYeBear 
	is to help ascertain and refine the range description of bears in New York.
</p>
<p>
<b>3) What is citizen science and why is it necessary to use it to study black bears in New York?</b><br>
	Citizen science is a well-established way to conduct research, where citizens, volunteers, and non-professional scientists play a central
	role in the research. Citizen science can refer to citizens' involvement in various aspects of research, from forming research questions and hypotheses, 
	to data collection, data analysis, and the sharing of research results. Just about anybody can be a citizen science, so this is a good way to collect
	large amounts of data, over large spatial regions, and over extended periods of time. Citizen science has proven to work very well for monitoring different
	species (birds, mammals, reptiles, etc) across large extents. NYeBear depends on citizens to help collect data about bears because almost 90% of land
	in New York is private land - land that researchers and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation would have difficulty getting data on.
	Also, a citizen science approach allows citizens to have a role in the research and management decisions that affect the world we live in.

<p>
<b>4) What types of data does NYeBear collect?</b><br>
	NYeBear collects data on the detection and non-detection  of black bears across upstate New York, year round. If a bear is observed on a trail camera or
	on a hike, or if bear sign (hair, scat, pawprint) is observed, this is "detection" data. When no signs of bear are observed, this is "non-detection data".
	Both are equally important, because it helps us be confident about both where there are and where there arent bears.
	When you report data about a hike, your outdoor camera, or a visit to a research site, make sure you report all your data about when and where you
	did and didnt see bear!  
</p>
<p>
<b>5) What do I do if I'm not sure what I saw was a bear or bear sign?</b><br>
	There are two things you should do. First, look at <a href="recognizing.html"> Recognizing black bear signs </a> to help you. Second, when you submit your data, include in 
	your comments if you are not sure. Finally, you can always  <a href="contact.html"> contact </a> the researchers with a description and photos. 

	Citizen science has the ability to collect large amounts of data, but methods also need to be in place to maintain the quality of the data too.
	This is one reason why we ask citizen scientists to submit photos of their observations - to verify unsure observerations. The researchers will 
	also help ensure data quality by following up on missing data and contacting citizen scientists. 

</p>
<p>
<b>6) How long does the NYeBear project run?</b><br>
	NYeBear will potentially run for ~4 years, or longer. 2015 is the first year of the project, and it is a pilot year to finetune the project. This 
	will be useful for researchers to learn	how to make NYeBear successful for the course of the project. We encourage citizen scientists to participate 
	for as long as possible, since this provides long-term continuous data.
</p>
<p>
<b>7) Where can I learn more about black bears in New York?</b><br>
	There are many resources online about black bears in general. For more information specific to New York, visit the <a 
href="http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/6960.html"> New York State Department of Environmental 
Conservation&#39;s website </a>
	about black bears.  To learn more about NYeBear and related research, you can visit the website of the graduate student orchestrating this research, <a href=http://catsun.squarespace.com> Cat Sun </a>.
